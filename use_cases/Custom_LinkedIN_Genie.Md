# ðŸŽ¯ Custom LinkedIn Genie

This is an experiment to automate my style of writing LinkedIn posts by creating an effective prompt to teach large language models like Claude 3.5 Sonnet or GPT-4. I achieved this via a simple reverse engineering paradigm, ie letting the llms analyze my posts and getting to a prompt to generate similar posts while I gave feedbacks on the newly generated posts.

## ðŸ’¡ Why This Matters

- Faster sharing of my insights while retaining my mode of converying ideas
- Hassle free formatting and paraphrasing of the content itself without getting the core idea lost
- Efficient repurposing of verbose techincal projects and experimentations into engaging , crisp and easily digestable social content
- Possibility of future delegation of insight sharing to a team where I am focussed on a brand building venture of the same 
- Once in a blue moon, improving my own capability of quick drafting of ideas
